# Code of Conduct

## Purpose and Values

This project is a collaborative academic effort. Our goal is not only to produce strong technical work, but to work together in a way that reflects respect, integrity, and inclusion.

We believe that good data science depends on trust, open communication, and thoughtful collaboration. Every contributor should feel safe asking questions, sharing ideas, and providing feedback.

We are committed to building a respectful and inclusive environment for everyone involved in this project.


## Who This Applies To

This Code of Conduct applies to all contributors and participants in this project, including:

* GitHub issues and pull requests
* Code reviews
* Project discussions
* Meetings and work-related communication
* Any project-related social or academic interactions

We welcome individuals of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to, differences in race, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, nationality, and level of experience.


## Expected Behaviour

All contributors are expected to:

* Treat others with respect and professionalism
* Use clear and considerate language
* Provide constructive feedback focused on ideas, not individuals
* Be open to different perspectives
* Take responsibility for the impact of their words and actions
* Communicate disagreements respectfully

We encourage collaboration, curiosity, and patience — especially when working through technical challenges.


## Unacceptable Behaviour

The following behaviour will not be tolerated:

* Harassment, discrimination, or exclusionary conduct
* Personal attacks or insults
* Offensive comments related to identity or background
* Intimidation or threats
* Dismissive, hostile, or demeaning language
* Sharing private information without consent
* Retaliation against someone who raises a concern

Subtle behaviours that create discomfort or exclusion — even if not intended — are also taken seriously.


## Reporting Concerns

If you experience or witness behaviour that violates this Code of Conduct:

1. You may contact one of the project maintainers directly.
2. If the concern involves a maintainer or you are uncomfortable reporting internally, you may escalate the issue to the course instructional team.

Reports will be handled respectfully and confidentially to the extent possible. Retaliation against anyone who reports a concern is not acceptable.

When a report is made, we will:

* Review the concern promptly
* Speak with relevant parties
* Determine appropriate next steps
* Follow up when necessary


## Consequences

Responses to violations may include:

* A private conversation or warning
* Removal of inappropriate content
* Temporary suspension from collaboration
* Permanent removal from the project
* Escalation to course instructors if required

Actions will be proportional to the severity and impact of the behaviour.


## Commitment to Improvement

This Code of Conduct is a living document. As our project evolves, we may update it to better reflect our values and ensure a respectful working environment.

By participating in this project, all contributors agree to follow this Code of Conduct and support a positive and inclusive collaboration.
